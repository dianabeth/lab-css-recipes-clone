        <p>
          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it.
          It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local
          competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
            flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil.
            Reduce temperature and let simmer.
          </li>

          <li>
            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
            lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
            so that it does not run off.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
